 ApplePicker, Mission Demolition and Prototype 1

 My goal in making my prototype is to make a game that is a combination of rollaball and apple picker. I wanted to make something that is cute and visually appealing to the user. Making collectable prefabs intuitive to the user in terms of what is a "positive" pickup and a "negative" dropped object that needs to be avoided. The influence of the MDA Framework was particularly clear because, as the designer, I was focusing on the Aesthetic outcome, how the player would feel while engaging with the game. I considered how visual choices could lead to emotional engagement, and how these choices shape the playerâ€™s overall experience.
